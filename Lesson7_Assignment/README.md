### Project Description:

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. ("$(document).ready(function(){ });" is used to keep jQuery from starting before the page is loaded.)
2. (jQuery can change CSS by different methods, including, addClass(), removeClass, toggleClass, and css().)
3. ("$("p").click();" will assign a click event (the precise moment when something happens) to all paragraphs.)
